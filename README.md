# where_to_find_my_code
You can find my public code projects at https://git.magicvoidpointers.com/madrocketsci

I like running my own websites and platforms. I operate various Linode servers to host email, my blog, and code projects. If you are looking for public-facing projects for Aaron M. Schinder, look at my gitea server on magicvoidpointers.com.
